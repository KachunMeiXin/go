            <p>Keeping watch: While Paulo Josue (left) and Syamer Kutty Abba are more wary of their surroundings, they also pray for the speedy recovery of their fellow footballers.</p>
            <p>PETALING JAYA: After a spate of attacks on three national footballers, other players are beginning to look over their shoulders whenever they are outside.

Penang midfielder Syamer Kutty Abba, who is on loan from Johor Darul Ta’zim, is also limiting his movements.

“I am more vigilant now. I am not going out so much,” said Syamer.

Syamer was disheartened to see his friends go through such harrowing situations.

“No one should endure that (kind of experience). Personally, I feel for all three because they are my mates,” he said.

Last week, Terengganu’s Akhyar Rashid, also on loan from JDT, suffered injuries to his head and leg after being attacked by two robbers in his housing area in Kuala Terengganu.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Selangor player Faisal Halim suffered fourth degree burns after being splashed with acid at a shopping mall in Petaling Jaya. JDT midfielder Safiq Rahim became the latest victim of crime when his car’s rear windscreen was smashed by two men in Johor Baru.Syamer hopes the authorities can tighten security as he doesn’t want to see what happened to Faisal, Akhyar and Safiq happen again.

“I am praying for all three to recover from the episodes.”

Syamer also revealed that he spoke to Akhyar and he is in good spirits.

“He told me his injuries are healing and he will be back sooner.”

    Paulo Josue is shocked to learn of the attacks.</p>

<p>The naturalised midfielder, who hails from Brazil, said,”I feel sad. In Brazil, fans berating players and so on is normal but not to the point of violence,” said the 35-year-old, who captains Kuala Lumpur in the Super League.

Josue said although he was not as famous as the Malaysian players, he would still be vigilant of his surroundings.

“I do not feel that I am that famous. Few people know me. I feel much safer than Mickey, Aky (Akhyar) and Chopot (Safiq) because they are famous personalities in the Malaysian game.

“They always gave their attention to people but things will change now. I am more aware of my surroundings.

    “As for safety management from clubs, we are waiting for our management to speak to us but I believe something is being done. The three cases that happened, it’s unusual in Malaysian football. They may need time to understand.</p>

<p>“I pray that Mickey (Faisal) recovers quickly. A lot of people told me the effects of an acid attack and it’s crazy to see that happening to a fellow professional.

“I just wish and pray that he would get back to the pitch as soon as possible and give joy to Malaysia and Selangor fans.”

Meanwhile, Sabah midfielder Stuart Wilkin was shocked to know about the incidents.

    “As a fellow professional, I just want them to recover well and get back on the pitch.”</p>

            <p>The Malaysian Football League (MFL) have urged clubs to beef up security and some administrators including Football Association of Malaysia president Hamidin Mohd Amin even suggested that players hire bodyguards if they can afford it</p>
